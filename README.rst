UI For RASENMAEHER

React, TS etc

Docker
------

For more controlled deployments and to get rid of "works on my computer" -syndrome, we always
make sure our software works under docker.

It's also a quick way to get started with a standard development environment.

SSH agent forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need buildkit_::

    export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

.. _buildkit: https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/

And also the exact way for forwarding agent to running instance is different on OSX::

    export DOCKER_SSHAGENT="-v /run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock:/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock"

and Linux::

    export DOCKER_SSHAGENT="-v $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK"

Creating a development container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build image, create container and start it::

    docker build --ssh default --target devel_shell -t rasenmaeher_ui:devel_shell .
    docker create --name rmui_devel -v `pwd`":/app" -p 8002:8002 -it `echo $DOCKER_SSHAGENT` rasenmaeher_ui:devel_shell
    docker start -i rmui_devel

Note: due to the volume mapping if you already had run "npm install" on the host you need to delete the node_modules directory
and in any case you need to run "npm install" inside the container.


pre-commit considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If working in Docker instead of native env you need to run the pre-commit checks in docker too::

    docker exec -i rmui_devel /bin/bash -c "pre-commit install"
    docker exec -i rmui_devel /bin/bash -c "pre-commit run --all-files"

You need to have the container running, see above. Or alternatively use the docker run syntax but using
the running container is faster::

    docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`":/app" rasenmaeher_ui:devel_shell -c "pre-commit run --all-files"


Production docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will just deliver the compiled files to a mounted directory

    docker build --ssh default --target production -t rasenmaeher_ui:amd64-latest .
    docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`/rmui_files:/deliver rasenmaeher_ui:amd64-latest


Then you need to serve things so that index.html is the default controller for things, nginx example::

    location / {
        index index.html;
        root /rmui_files;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
    }

Development
-----------

TLDR:

- Create and activate a Node 18 virtualenv::

    FIXME: Insert instructions

- change to a branch::

    git checkout -b my_branch

- Install project deps and pre-commit hooks::

    npm install
    pre-commit install
    pre-commit run --all-files

- Ready to go.

Remember to activate your virtualenv whenever working on the repo.

Asset set
^^^^^^^^^

Asset set is loaded according to VITE_ASSET_SET enviroment variable.
Changing asset set requires reloading vite.
Folder assetSetStore contains files for for different sets that are copied to src/assets/set/ folder on startup.
Current set is tracked with setName.txt file.

When you want to use dynamic assets, you want to make sure your dynamic asset has equivalent for sets (both "fdf" and "neutral", so on). If the assets are images, you want to then import them to your components from /assets/set/* where the env-defined assets are placed by VITE on startup. If the assets are translation keys, make sure keys are present in locales under assetSetStore, and then use the "dynamic" namespace for accessing them.
